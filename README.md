## Howdy


- I've been playing with ways to understand/learn/teach various statistical ideas in the context of the Ising model.
- Partition function zeros are also something pretty amazing. I am working to better understand their behavior in complex systems.
- Functional renormalization group and Monte Carlo.
- Would love to figure out what neural networks could afford my studies.
